THIS FOLDER AND PROJECT CONTATINS PATH FILES IN ORDER FOR THE PROGRAMS TO WORK YOU WILL
HAVE TO CHANGE THE PATH FILES AND IF DOING THE CSV FILES YOU WILL HAVE TO GENERATE THE CSV FILES
ISMIR04 YOU WOULD HAVE TO CREATE 3 DIFFERENT CSV FILE AND RENAME THEM AND ALSO WILL HAVE TO CHNAGE
THE ARGUMENTS AND PARAMETERS TO WORK FOR EITHER THE GTZAN AND ISMIR04 SINCE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT 
COLOUMN NAMES AND STRUCTIRE FOR NAME AND PATHS SO YOU WILL HAVE TO ADJUST IT OR JUST CREATE YOUR OWN.

THE CONVERT2WAV AND UPDATE PATHS YOU WILL CHANGE THE PATHS AND GENREATE AND CHANGE THEM FOR ALL 3 SET
HOWEVER THIS SHOULD HAVE ALL WAV FILES AND PATHS FILES ALREADY GENERATED.

THAT GOES SAME FOR THE CNN FILES THEY CONTAIN PATHS THAT NEED TO BE REWRITTEN INDORER FOR THE
PROGAMS TO WORK.

TESTING.py AND 2DATATESTIN.py ARE JUST FILES THAT JUST SHOW PROGRESS TO CREATE THE FULL PROGRAM FILE

ANOTHER THING TO MENTION IS THAT FOR THE GTZANMUSICCLASSIFICATION AND THE MUSICCLASSIFICATIONV1 NOTE BOOKS HAVE COMMENTED OUT CODE THAT YOU CAN USE TO CHANGE BETWEEN USING PARALLE PROCESSING AND NOT USING IT. SO BEWARE AND ADJUST SO YOU DONT CRASH OR DAMAGE YOUR SYSTEM.
